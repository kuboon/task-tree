/**
 * Every URL the app answers, in one place.
 *
 * `server/router.tsx` maps these to the controllers that answer them, and everything that links
 * reads `routes.my.href()` rather than rebuilding `${base}/my` at each call site.
 *
 * The map is built with the deploy prefix as its base, so hrefs are correct under a GitHub Pages
 * repo sub-path or a PR preview URL without anyone prepending anything. On Deno Deploy `base` is
 * empty.
 *
 * Two kinds of route live here and they are deployed differently:
 *
 * - **Pages** (`home`, `hydration`, `my`) are rendered to static HTML by the GitHub Pages build as
 *   well as served live by Deno Deploy.
 * - **Server routes** (`jwks` and everything under `api`) only exist on the live server. Nothing
 *   links to them, so the static build's crawl never reaches them, and they are not in
 *   `entryPoints`. The client may still name them (`routes.api.notify.href()`), which is why the
 *   shapes are stated here — a static deploy simply has no server to answer them.
