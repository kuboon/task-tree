/**
 * The blog: the articles, and the routes that serve them.
 *
 * This module is the blog's entry — `router.ts` imports `blogController` from here and nothing else.
 * It sits in the directory the articles are in, so the files it reads are its own siblings and
 * `import.meta.dirname` is the only path involved; there is no article directory written down
 * elsewhere for this to fall out of step with.
 *
 * Everything Markdown is here: the front-matter shape, the parser, the file reads, and the
 * Markdown-to-nodes step. `@kuboon/md` and `@std/front-matter` are imported from nowhere else,
 * which is what keeps Markdown out of the generator — it serves what this site's own code returns.
 * The two screens are next door: `index.tsx` lists the articles, `article.tsx` shows one.
 *
 * An article is a route like any other page rather than a file served off disk, which is also why
 * these source files are safe to keep beside the `.md` ones: nothing serves the directory, so
 * nothing can serve the source.
