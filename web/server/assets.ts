/**
 * The browser modules, compiled as one graph.
 *
 * Every entrypoint below goes into a single `Deno.bundle({ codeSplitting: true })` call, which is
 * the point: a module two of them import — the Remix UI runtime, the DPoP session store — is
 * emitted once, into a chunk both import, so it is one module at runtime rather than two copies
 * with two states.
 *
 * The islands are globbed rather than listed: an island is a file in a directory, and that is the
 * decision. `@remix-kbn/assets-deno` expands the pattern at startup, sorted, and fails on a
 * pattern that matches nothing.
 *
 * Every path here is under `client/`: this is the server compiling the browser's half of the app.
